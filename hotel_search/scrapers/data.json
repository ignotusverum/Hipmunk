The Program is nine days; however, you can mix and match any of the following segments to fit your schedule. <br/><br/> NORTH OF JORDAN<br/>It is a very special way to start discovering the north of Jordan as we do it in a style equal to the king's highway. <br/><br/>We start our trip from Amman around 8:00 am heading to Jerash, the roman city. This is the first thumb in our program which will take us around 45 minutes to reach from Amman.  We will spend between one to tow hours at Jerash and then afterward we will visit Ajloun castle to enjoy its wonderful Islamic decorations above the hills. from there you can see the Jordan River and Palestine as well. After spending around half an hour we head to Bella to visit lots of old churches with magnificent decorations which show the roman historical thumbs, then to the hills of Umm Qais the Napatean historical site. A very interesting thought:  you will be standing in Jordan and at the same time watching the other tow borders in front of your eyes, the Syrian & the Israeli boarders which present a unique experience as well as you are only just a few steps away from The Jolan Syrian heights and Tabria Lake in Israel. From there we usually take a special road after visiting the Syrian Hemma (hot spring water) adjoining the Al-YArmok river which runs into the Jordan river and the Israeli border .<br/>We head back to Amman taking another road making it a circle road. <br/><br/>DESERT CASTLES <br/>There used to be around ten castles, but after the earthquake which happened in Jordan only one fifth of them still standing. Our trip will start around 8:00 am heading from Amman.<br/>1) Qasar halabat  2) Hammam Al Sarah<br/>3) Al-kharaneh Castle  4) -Amra Castle <br/>5) Al-azraq Castle (Lawrence of Arabia palace)<br/>The visitors will enjoy visiting these castles in the desert. They are centrally located to three borders (Jordan-Saudi Arabia- Iraq)<br/>It is safe and quiet trip. We will back to Amman by the end of the day.<br/><br/>SOUTH OF JORDAN <br/>(PETRA/ WADI RUM & AQABA)  <br/>There are three deferent ways to do the trip <br/>- The desert road<br/>- Wadi Araba close to the Israeli borders<br/>- The king's highway<br/>THE KING'S HIGHWAY <br/>There are lots of companies and travel agents that do organize this kind of a trip in one day. However, our company makes this trip in tow stages.<br/>The First day:  From Amman to Madaba to see the mosaics and visit the churches especially saint George church which holds an old map of more than 1500 years old which represents the Middle East, then to mount Nebo. If the whether permits, we will be able to see Jerusalem, Jericho, and the Dead Sea. Afterward we will go down to visit the baptism. Then to the Dead Sea to enjoy the salty water and the mud mask.<br/><br/>KING'S HIGHWAY NEXT DAY <br/>The Second Day: Start from Amman to finish the king's highway to madaba without stopping.

At the same time you can listen to the voices of silence around you which could not be heard anywhere in the world. Then we will go down to visit al shouback castle and at the end of the day we will reach wadi mousa to spend the night. <br/>PETRA <br/>Visiting Petra should not be missed as it is once in a life time experience and has been considered as one of the world's most fascinating places.<br/>Usually it is s full day trip.
